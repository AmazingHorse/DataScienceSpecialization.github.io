# Zero to git (win7/8)

### Or, how to get by on bash

The command line.

A wondrous yet infuriating tool, maligned by many, misunderstood by most, its purpose has been reduced over time with the introduction of graphical user interfaces such as the one this page is based in. However, when working with file systems, most sorts of programming, and git - it can be very helpful. 

This intends to be a guide for three things:

1. going from a user that is comfortable with using the GUI to one that can rock out such useful things like ```$ g c -am "quick commit!"``` or a ```$ echo "## Mark me down, matey!" > ~/github/dsc/arrr.md``` and know what the hell they mean and do.
2. Securing your github accesses and save typing in your username and password all the time.
3. Setting a few rules to make your experience more enjoyable

### How do I even?

- [download msysgit](https://github.com/msysgit/msysgit/releases/download/Git-1.9.5-preview20141217/Git-1.9.5-preview20141217.exe), [puttygen](http://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/latest/x86/puttygen.exe), and a text editor of your choice ([psst...here](http://download.tuxfamily.org/notepadplus/6.7.4/npp.6.7.4.Installer.exe)).

- Create a folder in an auspicious place outside of the windows directory structure. Why? Because windows uses annoying-to-type characters in its folder names. Which leads us to the first rule of command line:
> Thou shalt not use spaces, capitals, or any other random symbols in naming files or folders. Just don't.
  - OK: the root of your C:/ drive, or in a nice short folder like C:/school/datascience
  - BETTER: create a new drive, and place your work there like W:/datascience. Why is this better? It makes your work easier to back up.
- Next, startup msysgit. You should have a window like this:
