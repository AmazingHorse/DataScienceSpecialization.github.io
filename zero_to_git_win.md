# Zero to git (win7/8)

### Or, how to get by on bash

The command line.

A wondrous yet infuriating tool, maligned by many, misunderstood by most, its purpose has been reduced over time with the introduction of graphical user interfaces such as the one this page is based in. However, when working with file systems, most sorts of programming, and git - it can be very helpful. 

This intends to be a guide to going from a user that is comfortable with using the GUI to one that can rock out a

```
$ g c -am "quick commit!"
```
or a

```
$ g res HEAD~1
```

and know what the hell it means. Additionally you will secure your github accesses and save typing in your username and password all the time.

### How do I even?

You will need to first [download msysgit](), [puttygen](), and a text editor of your choice ([psst...here]())

This guide is complete by no means. Inquisitive minds are invited to fork the github page [here](https://github.com/DataScienceSpecialization/DataScienceSpecialization.github.io) and create their very own pull request.
